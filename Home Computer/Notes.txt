Mounted the image with the built in image mounter in Kali. I did this in the gui but can be done via command line with the proper mount command

After navigating around there is a credentials.txt file in Documents

/media/root/Family/Users/Family/Documents# cat credentials.txt 
I keep pictures of my credentials in extended attributes.


I noticed credentials.txt seemed to be the only non 0 byte file so if figured i'd look for others. 
/media/root/Family# find . -type f -not -empty -ls
    13288      1 -rwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           58 Jun 12 20:38 ./Users/Family/Documents/credentials.txt
Only 1 file returned.

Googled to find out how to access extended attributes. Found some Mitre pages and Zeroaccess malware

Tried exiftool, strings and xxd but didn't find anything
Googled and found

getfattr -d -m - credentials.txt > /root/Documents/EAcreds


I put the output into cyber chef with the “magic” recipe and deleted the "user.FILE0=0" which showed the output matching the input i then deleted 1 char at a time until  the output returned something different.

From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9+/=',true)

I clicked use this recipe and it desplayed the image containing the flag

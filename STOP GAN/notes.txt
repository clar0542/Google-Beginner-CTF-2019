So they're hinting at buffer overflow

buffer-overflow.ctfcompetition.com 1337

found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVlTDPhTA9U and tried basic buffer overflow with A's 

nc buffer-overflow.ctfcompetition.com 1337
run
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


I used python -c "print 'A'*30" and incremented the # of A's until it crashed. 

I didn't get the bonus flag. 

I think the challenge is hinting at using pwn tools to do this. I might go back and see if i can do it that way for fun.
